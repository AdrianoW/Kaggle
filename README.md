Kaggle
======

This repository contains my analysis on various kaggle competitions. 

I usually use Python and its notebook, but it may contain R code as well.

Each folder is one competition that I have participated.  

### So far:

top 25%: SpringLeaf and Rossman

### Structure

The folders contain mainly scripts used. I will make them more presentable in the future.

Bank and Bike sharing are a little tidier.
